Top is highest precedence (will be evaluated first)

1. URL template with more segments.
    Ex: "a/b/c/d" is higher than "a/b/c"
2. URL template with literal text has more precedence than a parameter segment. 
    Ex: "a/b" is higher than "a/{parameter}"
3. URL template that has a parameter segment with constraints has more precedence
    a parameter segment without constraints.
    Ex: "a/b:int" is higher than "a/b".
4. Catch-all parameters (**)
    Ex: "a/b" is higher than "a/**".
